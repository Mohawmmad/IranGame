# IranGame
This repository contains code for a 'Cops And Robbers' game mode designed for the SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) platform, specifically tailored for the IranGame server.

Welcome to the repository of a piece of my gaming history!

Back in the day, when I was just 15 years old, I was diving into the world of PAWN scripting for the popular online multiplayer mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas called SA-MP. At that time, I was running my own server called 'IranGame,' and the game mode I developed was 'Cops and Robbers.'

This code was written by me, albeit not entirely. It dates back to 8 years ago when I was just 15 years old and learning Pawn scripting. I stumbled upon this code after many years and decided to share it as a keepsake. At that time, I was running a server named 'IranGame' featuring the 'Cops and Robbers' game mode in San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) in Iran. This nostalgic piece of code brings back fond memories of my journey in the SA-MP world.

Fast forward 8 years, and I stumbled upon this old code, triggering a wave of nostalgia and fond memories. I decided to share it as a tribute to the good old days. While I may not have completed this code entirely, it's a testament to my early journey as a coder and the creativity that was sparked during those times. Feel free to explore the code, contribute if you wish, and perhaps even use it as a starting point for your own SA-MP projects.
